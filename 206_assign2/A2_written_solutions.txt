Q1

a), b) Fully implemented. If the input is too big then the size of the result is far bigger than the screen width, so in that case doesn't look right.


Q2

a), b) Both versions should work. The imageChat program throws a warning, but the program works regardless. I forgot to add a space after the chathandle, I didn't want to make last minute changes which might introduce bugs.
